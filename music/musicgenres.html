    <h2><p>A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared
 tradition or set of conventions. It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style, although
 in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.</p></h2>

 <ul><li><h3><b>Rock music</b></h3></li></ul>
      <img src="rock.jpg" alt="myrock">
    <h3><p>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United
              States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the 
              mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. The sound of 
              rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar, which emerged in its modern
             form in the 1950s with the popularity of rock and roll. Also, it was influenced by the sounds of
             electric blues guitarists. The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported
             by an electric bass guitar, which pioneered in jazz music in the same era, and percussion produce
             from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals. This trio of instruments has often been
             complemented by the inclusion of other instruments. </p></h3>

    <h3><p>Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the
           United States and the United Kingdom. The terms popular music and pop music are often used
           interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate
           styles. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented
          styles it influenced. Rock and pop remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop
           became associated with music that was more commercial and accessible
